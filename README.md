# HEACalc-1.0
Research tool for finding new high entropy alloys (HEA) by thermodynamics and machine-learning by existing literature data

Finding new metallic alloys has never been easier.

Type in chemical symbol of metal (i.e. Fe, Cu, co, ti,..), it's not case sensitive! Then play around with sliders to manipulate chemical composition,
it's displayed in real time, together with all corresponding thermodynamic properties on the right-hand side. AI tells you the machine-learning prediction
of the structure that is likely to form upon experimental data published in more than 300 scientific papers.

You can choose Advanced radiobutton to perform correlations of complex parameters, build from basic ones.

Finally, there is iterator machine, which performs automatic calculation for given elements, in given interval of atomic % and given step size..
